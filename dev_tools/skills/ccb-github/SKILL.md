# CCB GitHub Release Maintainer

## Core Rule

Treat GitHub as the user-facing product page. A release is not done until local version files, both READMEs, changelog, GitHub Release, release assets, and Actions status all agree.

GitHub's repository homepage renders README from the default branch, not from the latest release tag. If release documentation is prepared on a feature or hotfix branch, merge that branch to the default branch before calling the homepage updated.

Use repository `SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge` unless the user explicitly gives a different repo.

## Quick Audit

From the CCB repo root, run the bundled checker before and after release work:

```bash
CHECKER="dev_tools/skills/ccb-github/scripts/check_release_state.py"

python "$CHECKER" --phase prepare --repo SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge
python "$CHECKER" --phase published --repo SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge
```

The checker is read-only. It catches mechanical drift, but still manually inspect the top of `README.md` and `README_zh.md` because stale "What's New" prose can be semantically wrong even when version numbers are correct.

## Decision Tree

- Before tagging: run `--phase prepare`; fix every FAIL before creating a tag.
- After pushing a tag or creating a release: run `--phase published`; fix every FAIL before reporting success.
- After an interruption: run both phases, then follow the recovery runbook below from the first failing state.
- During README-only maintenance: still run `--phase prepare` so version badges, release notes, install URLs, and memory wording stay aligned.
- When the user asks for the final published result, include commit, push, merge-to-main when needed, GitHub Actions verification, Release assets verification, and homepage README verification.

## Release Preparation Checklist

Update these files together:

- `VERSION`
- `ccb` `VERSION = "..."`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `README.md`
- `README_zh.md`

README requirements:

- Top version badge must match the new version.
- "What's New" / "最新亮点" must describe the current release, not an older milestone; compare it against the newest `CHANGELOG.md` section and ensure it covers the most important user-facing bullets.
- "Config Control" / "配置控制" must stay aligned with current `.ccb/ccb.config` behavior.
- Keep the shared memory wording concise: `.ccb/ccb_memory.md` is the project-wide shared memory document.
- Do not reintroduce root `CCB.md` support or mention it as a current feature.
- Install commands must point at the actual public GitHub repo.
- Release Notes / 新版本记录 must include the new version near the top.

GitHub repo homepage requirements:

- `gh repo view SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge --json description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics,latestRelease`
- Description and topics should match the current public positioning.
- If README install URLs or badge links point to an old owner, fix them before tagging.

## Local Verification

Run at least:

```bash
pytest -q
python -m compileall -q lib ccb
git diff --check
python scripts/build_linux_release.py --allow-dirty --output-dir dist-release-local
```

For startup, tmux, ccbd, provider auth, or release asset changes, add the relevant targeted tests or smoke commands before publishing.

## Publish Sequence

Use this order:

1. Commit release changes.
2. Push the branch.
3. Merge the release branch into the default branch when the repository homepage must reflect the release docs:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull --ff-only origin main
   git merge --no-ff <release-branch>
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Create and push tag `vX.Y.Z` from the intended release commit.
5. Create the GitHub Release page for `vX.Y.Z`.
6. Let `Release Artifacts` upload assets.
7. Confirm `Release Artifacts` is green for the tag or a valid `workflow_dispatch` recovery, and confirm branch validation workflows for the release commit are green or consciously accepted as warnings:
   - `Tests`
   - `CCBD Real Platform Smoke`
   - `Cross-Platform Compatibility Test`
8. Confirm release assets exist:
   - `ccb-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
   - `ccb-macos-universal.tar.gz`
   - `SHA256SUMS`
9. Confirm the GitHub homepage README is updated by reading default-branch README through GitHub:
   ```bash
   gh api 'repos/SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge/contents/README.md?ref=main' --jq .content | base64 -d | rg 'version-|vX.Y.Z'
   ```

The current workflow expects the Release page to exist before uploading assets. If `Release Artifacts` fails with `release not found`, create the Release and rerun the workflow.

## Recovery Runbook

Use the checker output first; each FAIL includes a suggested fix. Common cases:

- Release page missing: create it with `gh release create vX.Y.Z --repo SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge --title vX.Y.Z --notes-file <notes-file>`, then rerun `Release Artifacts`.
- Release Artifacts recovered through `workflow_dispatch`: run it with input `tag=vX.Y.Z`; the checker accepts this but warns if the workflow head SHA does not match the release tag.
- Release assets missing: rerun the `Release Artifacts` workflow for the tag, then verify `ccb-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, `ccb-macos-universal.tar.gz`, and `SHA256SUMS`.
- Tag missing locally or remotely: stop and confirm the intended release commit before creating or pushing the tag.
- Tag SHA mismatch: do not force-push automatically; inspect the tag and ask for explicit maintainer approval before rewriting release history.
- GitHub CLI unauthenticated: run `gh auth login`, then rerun the published check.
- Workflow red: open the failed run, fix the root cause, rerun the workflow, and keep the release incomplete until it is green.
- README install URL mismatch: update both English and Chinese install snippets to the active public repo.
- GitHub homepage still shows an old version: merge/push the release documentation changes to the default branch; updating a tag or non-default branch is not enough.
- Empty changelog or README release entry: add concrete user-facing bullets, not placeholder headings.

## Post-Release Verification

Run:

```bash
gh release view vX.Y.Z --repo SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge --json tagName,url,assets
gh run list --repo SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge --limit 10
gh api 'repos/SeemSeam/claude_codex_bridge/contents/README.md?ref=main' --jq .content | base64 -d | rg 'version-|vX.Y.Z'
git status --short --branch
```

Report only the useful facts: version, commit/tag, release URL, key fixes, test status, artifact status, and whether the worktree is clean.

## Stop Conditions

Do not call the release complete if any of these are true:

- README or README_zh still shows an old current version or stale current-release highlights.
- `VERSION`, `ccb`, changelog, badges, or release notes disagree.
- The release tag is missing, points to the wrong commit, or differs between local and origin.
- GitHub latest release does not point to the new tag after publish.
- Required release assets are missing.
- `SHA256SUMS` does not contain checksum entries for every required tarball asset.
- Tests or Release Artifacts failed.
- GitHub homepage README on `main` still shows an old current version.
- The worktree has uncommitted release edits.

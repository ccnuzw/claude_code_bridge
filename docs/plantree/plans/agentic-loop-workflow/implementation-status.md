# Agentic Loop Workflow Implementation Status

Date: 2026-07-13
Status: In progress — G6C root14 repairs landed, rework smoke stability blocker active
Branch: `workflow/g6c-integration`
Worktree: `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_worktrees/g6c-integration`
Current HEAD before this status update: `81d8d060`

## Current Phase

The active release target is single-lane production closure: one visible
Frontdesk-started lane with one semantic orchestration bundle and one to four
reviewed `Worker + Reviewer` workgroups. G0-G5, Decision 027, and Decision 028
are accepted. Decision 029 P0-P4 source implementation is integrated; P5
direct acceptance is active.

Root14 passed fresh project startup, the Frontdesk capability handoff, exact
five-task Planner import, repo-independent verification, and an L1 real
Worker/Reviewer/Round Reviewer `done/pass`. L2 then exposed Orchestrator
RolePack fence-language drift: the provider used the bundle schema as the code
fence language, and the importer correctly failed closed because literal
fenced JSON was absent. Root14 was rejected and safely unmounted. A separate
harness replay defect was also confirmed after a failed precondition consumed
a fixed read-only observation label. The RolePack, recovery, and exact
controller-boundary regressions have now landed and their focused gates pass.
Root15 remains forbidden because the complete single-lane fake-runtime smoke
twice exposed non-deterministic rework exact-once and cleanup failures that do
not reproduce in a single targeted rerun.

## Authority

- Release goal: [single-lane-multi-workgroup-release-goal.md](goals/single-lane-multi-workgroup-release-goal.md)
- Decision 029: [029-planner-feedback-and-task-set-closure.md](decisions/029-planner-feedback-and-task-set-closure.md)
- P0-P5 plan: [planner-feedback-and-task-set-closure-plan.md](topics/planner-feedback-and-task-set-closure-plan.md)
- Current checkpoint: [g6c-decision029-integration-and-root8-diagnostic-20260712.md](history/g6c-decision029-integration-and-root8-diagnostic-20260712.md)

Provider replies remain evidence only. Scripts own task, task-set, revision,
closure, integration, topology, round, release, and delivery authority.

## Last Landed

- `4f166209` through `43847d18`: Decision 029 schemas, parent authority,
  Detailer feedback, closure aggregation, Planner backfill, Frontdesk status,
  and source/fake protocol corpus.
- `50874729` through `a9f1e26e`: transport, retry lineage, transaction fencing,
  durable journals, and admission hardening.
- `4f80bc94` through `8faa6fa4`: activation-sidecar and parent-authority harness
  repairs discovered by fresh real runs.
- `d941fa2e` through `c37c4ac4`: shared stop-contract corpus, canonical
  Detailer provenance, monotonic state fencing, SHA-verified normal stops,
  fail-closed task scope, convergent semantic revisions, idempotent post-state,
  and auto-runner reconciliation semantics.
- `f09cb211` through `ec8fee16`: public three-layer architecture document,
  Mermaid flows, and reviewed SVG/PNG promotional graphic.
- `c4dbeed1` and `3a5e1810`: Frontdesk/Planner Git-capability contract and
  harness request injection; root13 proved the capability survives the real
  direct handoff with `controller_rewrote_body=false`.
- `c6bd0235` through `77c54a98`: bounded terminal constraint and settlement,
  Planner RolePack alignment, strict B7 closure evidence, real authority and
  restart/idempotence regressions, and mixed-terminal feedback closure.
- `82a3a622`: Gemini session observation now resumes safely after ccbd restart
  through an adapter-specific opt-in; the prior four full-suite failures are
  covered by durable terminal, session-cursor, rotation, and mutation evidence.
- `2e54d2df`: Orchestrator RolePack requires a literal `json` fence and keeps
  the bundle schema only in the JSON object's top-level `schema` field.
- `f7390fd0` and `3a4b41da`: read-only harness observation gains bounded
  recovery labels while mutating labels stay fail-closed, and the exact
  root14 schema-as-fence controller boundary is regression-covered.

Earlier accepted R1 authority/runtime evidence remains indexed at
[history/single-lane-r1-authority-runtime-closure-20260711.md](history/single-lane-r1-authority-runtime-closure-20260711.md).

## Active TODO

1. Reproduce and close the single-lane fake-runtime rework exact-once and
   release/zero-residue instability without sleeps or weaker checks.
2. Pass the complete single-lane smoke repeatedly and the current full source
   suite.
3. Run fresh visible root15 through
   all five routes, closure, B7, release, shutdown, and zero residue.
4. Complete remaining G6 three/four-workgroup, restart, busy-retain, and
   provider-profile rows from fresh opened projects.
5. Run G7 package/install/update/rollback gates and one visible installed-
   candidate workflow; keep G8 publication separately authorized.

## Blocked By

Blocked from root15 by a source/fake rework authority failure. After the first
Worker-owned Reviewer chain returns `rework_required`, the original Worker job
is terminal; the scheduler attempts a second `ask --chain ... reviewer from
worker` without creating a fresh Worker-rework parent job, and CCB correctly
rejects it because the sender has no active parent job. Production readiness
also remains gated by fresh real root15 acceptance, the remaining G6 matrix,
and G7 package/install/update/rollback acceptance.

## Acceptance Ownership

Workers may review and implement bounded source repairs. `talk2` directly
runs, observes, and audits real opened-project acceptance under
`/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2` using this worktree's explicit `ccb_test`,
inherited provider environment, and a root-local `AGENT_ROLES_STORE`. RolePack
changes go through `mother`; source/runtime diagnostics may use `ccb_self`.
When a worker needs a reviewer result to finish its current task, it must use
`ask --chain` or leave reviewer submission to `talk2`; `--silence` is only for
independent work whose successful result is not needed upstream.

## Last Verified

- Fourth-round independent detail-ready authority review: PASS at
  `c37c4ac4`; `344 passed`, `compileall` and `git diff --check` passed, with no
  High/Medium finding. Completion snapshot:
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/ccb_source/.ccb/ccbd/snapshots/job_2ccb4102700d.json`,
  SHA-256 `1d920d45af105b2ec1e9f1e8b455e2fc8ba133dcde5603e3b78f589dbd9b20b0`.
- Parent-authority harness checkpoint: `78 passed`.
- Current-HEAD full non-provider-blackbox gate: `4739 passed, 2 skipped,
  21 deselected in 732.49s`; `compileall`, `pyflakes`, and `git diff --check`
  passed after the one-line unused-import cleanup at `2d897845`.
- Root8: L1/L2 `done/pass`, L4 macro `replan_required`, L4 blocked `blocked`;
  L3 rejected after repeated Orchestrator activation and runner step limit.
- Root13: capability handoff and initial five-task import passed; L1/L2 and
  both L4 routes reached expected terminals. L3 reached `detail_ready`, then
  `job_564275f23588` was imported as `ready_for_orchestration` despite
  `status_recommendation=detail_ready`; the project was rejected, unmounted,
  and auto-runner pid `4118860` terminated with evidence preserved.
- Harness and RolePack gates at `3a5e1810`: `79 passed` and `24 passed`;
  `pyflakes`, `compileall`, `git diff --check`, and clean-worktree checks
  passed before root13.
- Bounded-terminal integration gates through `77c54a98`: harness `94 passed`,
  workflow core `351 passed`, RolePack/plan documents `56 passed`, with real
  no-monkeypatch closure and mixed-terminal feedback-chain coverage.
- Gemini restart recovery at `82a3a622`: the four prior failures passed
  independently, non-Gemini conservative restore boundaries passed `2`, and
  the complete Phase 2 entrypoint passed `77`.
- Current-HEAD full source suite: `4792 passed, 2 skipped in 732.93s`;
  `compileall`, `git diff --check`, changed-file `pyflakes`, and clean-worktree
  checks passed before this plan-only update.
- Root14: Frontdesk exact completion, committed direct Planner handoff with
  `controller_rewrote_body=false`, exact five-child task set, and L1
  `done/pass` all passed. L2 import failed closed with
  `orchestrator_reply_bundle_requires_fenced_json`; no L2 Worker was submitted.
  Pending guard passed, cleanup returned `state: unmounted`, all resident
  agents stopped, and no project process remained.
- Post-root14 focused gates at `3a4b41da`: Orchestrator RolePack `26 passed`,
  RolePack projection `68 passed`, Phase 6B harness `96 passed`, launch docs
  `30 passed`, loop controller `256 passed`, and Orchestrator/bundle selector
  `19 passed`.
- Complete single-lane smoke is not accepted: first run `37 passed, 2 failed`,
  second run `38 passed, 1 failed`. Failures involve
  `reviewer_rework_pass` and/or `reviewer_rework_exhausted_blocked`, including
  `rework_exactly_once` and on the second run release/dynamic/worktree residue.
  A targeted two-case rerun passed, so the instability remains unclosed rather
  than waived as flaky.
- Direct persistent-root reproduction confirmed the authority race. In
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/g5-rework-exhausted-talk2-20260713-01`, the
  Reviewer and callback continuation completed, but the round terminated with
  `review_chain_final_rework_required`, `rework_count=0`, no Worker-rework job,
  and no Reviewer recheck. A separate pass root at
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/g5-rework-pass-talk2-20260713-01` completed with
  `rework_count=1`. Worker3 independently preserved the exact second-chain
  rejection at
  `/home/bfly/yunwei/test_ccb2/single-lane-isolation-job-9b36df922204/solo-pass/test_real_cli_fake_runtime_sce0/g5-real-cli-reviewer_rework_pass`.

## Non-Claims

The branch is not production-ready. It is not yet a packaged candidate or
production/default-enablement claim. Root8 and root13 are diagnostic evidence,
not passes; root14 is also rejected evidence, not a pass. A green source suite
does not replace root15 or G6/G7 acceptance.
Three/four-workgroup, restart, busy-retain, provider qualification, G7
packaging, and G8 publication remain outside the current accepted claim.

The bounded earlier Phase 1-6 claim remains archived in
[history/phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260705.md](history/phase1-6-acceptance-report-20260705.md).

# Orchestration Bundle Candidate

Use this skill once per immaculate orchestrator activation. Consume only the
controller-supplied task packet, execution contract, detail artifacts,
effective-capacity snapshot, and expected bundle revision.

## Reply Contract

1. Return exactly one route decision:
   `direct_execution`, `needs_detail`, `macro_adjustment_request`, `blocked`,
   or `partial_completion`.
2. Return compact `orchestration_notes` citing the supplied task and contract
   refs.
3. For Config V3 `direct_execution` or `partial_completion`, always include
   exactly one fenced JSON candidate with schema
   `ccb.loop.orchestration_bundle_candidate.v1`. Include it even when one node
   is selected.
4. Config V2 may omit the candidate only for deterministic one-node
   compatibility. A decomposed Config V2 route must include it.

Candidate root fields are exactly `schema`, `task_id`, `bundle_revision`,
`selection`, `nodes`, `integration`, and `policy`. Selection fields are exactly
`workgroup_count`, `complexity`, `cutability`, `execution_shape`, and
`rationale`. `workgroup_count` must equal the node count. `integration` fields
are exactly `verification_refs` and `project_root_verification_refs`; do not
emit `mode`, `order`, merge strategy, dependency order, execution order, or
controller-owned integration settings. Both integration arrays must be
non-empty and must reference known task artifacts containing direct
verification commands. For a one-node bundle, copy the execution-contract
artifact ref into both `verification_refs` and
`project_root_verification_refs`; never emit an empty
`project_root_verification_refs` list. `policy` fields are exactly
`max_node_rework_rounds`, `on_required_node_failure`, and
`on_structural_failure`; do not emit capacity, workspace, release, topology, or
runtime policy fields. Policy values are literal: `max_node_rework_rounds`
must be the supplied integer within policy, `on_required_node_failure` must be
`partial_or_blocked`, and `on_structural_failure` must be `replan_required`.
Do not replace these with semantic alternatives such as rework, retry,
return_failed_node_for_rework, fail, abort, or controller_owned.

## Adaptive Selection

Choose the smallest justified workgroup count from 1 to 4 using task
complexity, cutability, independently reviewable scopes, explicit dependency
needs, and supplied effective-capacity evidence. Capacity is a ceiling, not a
target. Do not target a desired count, split work to fill capacity, or reduce a
semantically required count because dispatch would be inconvenient.

Use one node for atomic or tightly coupled work. Use additional nodes only
when every node has a complete bounded work packet, independently checkable
acceptance and verification refs, safe allowed paths, and explicit
dependencies where outputs interact. Independent nodes require disjoint
allowed paths.

Each node must include `node_id`, `workgroup_id`, `worker_profile`,
`reviewer_profile`, `depends_on`, `parallel_group`, a complete bounded
`work_packet`, `allowed_paths`, `acceptance_refs`, `verification_refs`, and a
unique deterministic `integration_order`. Set `worker_profile` to `coder` and
`reviewer_profile` to `code_reviewer`. Do not emit nested `coder` or
`code_reviewer` objects; put role-specific instructions inside `work_packet`.
`node_id` and `workgroup_id` must be short agent-name-safe identifiers: start
with a letter, use only letters, digits, `_`, or `-`, and contain at most 32
characters total. Prefer compact IDs such as `node-001`, `node-cli`, `wg-001`,
or `wg-cli`; do not use long task-title slugs.
`work_packet` must be one JSON string, not an object, array, or nested schema.
The work packet string must state its goal, declared refs, scope, non-goals,
dependency evidence, expected evidence, and verification obligations.
`parallel_group` is evidence only; it is not a topology communication edge or
dispatch instruction.

Every `verification_refs` and `project_root_verification_refs` artifact must
contain a `Verification:` or `Verification Commands:` section whose bullet
items are direct argv commands. They are executed without a shell by the
controller. Do not rely on `Verification Contract:` prose, `&&`, pipes,
redirection, command substitution, variable assignment, `cd`, `source`, or
`export`. If supplied refs do not contain bounded direct verification commands,
return structural `replan_required` evidence instead of emitting an execution
bundle.

Structural ambiguity requires `replan_required` evidence. Do not hide it with
silent serialization, count reduction, overlapping independent scopes, scope
shrinkage, fallback, or degradation.

## Authority Boundary

- Reply only; do not run `ccb`, `ccb_test`, wrappers, provider CLIs, or
  authority commands.
- Do not submit downstream asks or dispatch any role.
- Do not create task artifacts, work packets, tasks, loops, topology, agent
  names, panes, sessions, worktrees, branches, commits, or status transitions.
- The controller validates and imports candidate evidence, binds concrete
  agents, submits asks, integrates reviewed results, promotes or rolls back,
  records authority, and releases dynamic roles.
- Provider and model selection remain project configuration concerns. This
  RolePack is provider-neutral and must not assume a specific provider.
- There is no normal post-worker orchestrator activation. Only structural
  replan starts a new immaculate activation.

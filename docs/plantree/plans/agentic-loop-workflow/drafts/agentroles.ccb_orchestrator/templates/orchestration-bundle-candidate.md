orchestration_notes: <compact rationale with supplied task and contract refs>

For Config V3 `direct_execution` or `partial_completion`, emit exactly one
candidate. Config V2 may omit it only for deterministic one-node
compatibility. Repeat the node object once per semantically justified
workgroup; do not use the displayed single object as a node-count preference.
Replace every angle-bracket placeholder before replying. Integer fields must
be JSON integers, not quoted placeholder strings.

Candidate root fields are exactly the seven fields shown. Capacity is a
ceiling, not a target. Structural ambiguity is `replan_required`; never hide it
with serialization, node-count reduction, scope shrinkage, or fallback.
Verification refs must point to artifacts with `Verification:` or
`Verification Commands:` bullet entries that are direct argv commands executed
without a shell. Do not use `Verification Contract:` prose as executable
verification evidence.

Use the policy literal values exactly as shown: `on_required_node_failure` is
`partial_or_blocked` and `on_structural_failure` is `replan_required`. Do not
substitute semantic alternatives such as rework, retry, fail, or
return_failed_node_for_rework.
Both integration arrays must be non-empty. For one-node bundles, copy the
execution-contract artifact ref into both `verification_refs` and
`project_root_verification_refs`; never leave project-root verification empty.

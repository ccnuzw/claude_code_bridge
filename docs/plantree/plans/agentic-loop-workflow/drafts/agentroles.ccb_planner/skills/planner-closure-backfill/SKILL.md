# Planner Closure Backfill

Use this output contract only when the activation mode is exactly
`task_set_closure`. Initial intake remains owned by `planner-task-packet`.
Detailer replan input remains a distinct activation contract and must not be
mixed into this task-set closure proposal.

## Inputs

- expected PlanTree and task/task-set revisions
- original intake and Planner task refs
- validated Detailer macro-impact evidence, or task-set closure envelope
- child round, release, cleanup, and evidence digests
- current Brief/Roadmap/TODO summary supplied by the host

Do not run shell commands, file reads/searches, tests, builds, CCB commands, or
notification commands. Use only the compact authority envelope in the prompt.

## Semantic Decisions

Planner decides:

- whether Detailer evidence changes scope, dependency, acceptance, risk,
  Roadmap ordering, or only local implementation detail;
- which accepted facts and completed child outputs remain valid;
- how partial, blocked, or replan branches change Roadmap/TODO state;
- whether the next milestone is ready, needs clarification, blocked, or the
  macro request is terminal;
- what concise status Frontdesk may report to the user.

Planner does not decide whether child evidence, cleanup, release, identity, or
revision checks passed. Those are script-owned input facts.

## Output

Return exactly this one fenced section and no alternative authority shape:

## Rules

- `expected_plan_revision is a digest`: copy the supplied
  `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` value exactly. Never convert it to a counter,
  infer a newer revision, or repair a stale value in provider prose.
- Preserve the script-owned `aggregate_result` exactly. The complete mapping is
  `pass -> closure_complete`, `partial -> closure_partial`,
  `replan_required -> task_set_replanned`, and
  `blocked -> closure_blocked`. Never output a complete semantic result for
  non-pass; never output a complete semantic result for non-pass aggregate
  evidence.
- Derive `accepted_scope`, `unresolved_scope`, `blockers`, `replan_inputs`, and
  `evidence_refs` from the validated ordered child authority. These are Planner
  semantics and are not fields in script-owned `ccb.plan.task_set_closure.v1`.
  Never invent accepted scope or pass from missing/nonterminal evidence. `pass`
  requires empty unresolved/blocker/replan fields. Every non-pass requires
  non-empty `unresolved_scope`; `blocked` requires blockers and
  `replan_required` requires replan inputs.
- Never omit unresolved required scope from mixed outcomes.
- Multiple replan children produce one coherent macro proposal, not multiple
  independent Planner actions.
- Never overwrite a newer PlanTree revision. Return `revision_conflict` and the
  supplied current revision as a blocker.
- Preserve aggregate result, accepted scope, unresolved scope, blockers, next
  milestone, and evidence refs byte-for-byte in `frontdesk_status`.
- Embed exactly one complete `ccb.planner.frontdesk_status.v1` object under the
  sole `frontdesk_status` field, including when notification is not required.
- Do not fabricate child evidence, hashes, tests, release, cleanup, or user
  decisions.
- No PlanTree write, Frontdesk notification, CCB command, file operation, test,
  wait, watch, or downstream ask is allowed from this reply-only surface. The
  host validates and imports the proposal and owns every side effect.
- Do not modify PlanTree or send Frontdesk messages from the provider reply.

# Planner Task Packet

Use this skill when converting macro user intent or a frontdesk request into a
plan artifact for review.

## Inputs

- macro task request
- relevant plan-tree/source references
- explicit scope and non-goals
- current phase or prior round result if any

## Outputs

Produce these exact reply-visible sections. Do not replace them with prose,
tables, alternate headings, or "equivalent" sections.

Do not run shell commands, file searches, file reads, tests, builds, or CCB
commands before replying. Use only the intake evidence and compact artifacts
provided in the prompt.

- `task-packet.md`
- `readiness.json`
- `task-set.json` only when the controller prompt requests `Planner contract:
  task_set`
- `candidate-questions.jsonl` when user input may be needed

For single-slice work, use fenced blocks with these exact labels:

````markdown
**task-packet.md**
```markdown
# Task: <title>
Route: <direct_execution|needs_detail|macro_adjustment_request|blocked|partial_completion>
Allowed paths:
- <relative path, or leave empty when route is needs_detail/blocked>
Verification:
- <command or evidence review>
```

**readiness.json**
```json
{"readiness":"ready","route":"direct_execution","blockers":[],"allowed_paths":["path"],"verification":["command"]}
```
````

For task-set work, use exactly one fenced `**task-set.json**` section. Do not
also return single-task sections for the same reply.

````markdown
**task-set.json**
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "stable-bounded-task-id",
      "title": "Bounded task title",
      "route": "direct_execution",
      "readiness": "ready",
      "task_packet": "# Task: Bounded task title\nRoute: direct_execution\n",
      "execution_contract": "# Execution Contract\nRoute: direct_execution\n\nAllowed Change Paths:\n- relative/path\n",
      "allowed_paths": ["relative/path"],
      "verification": ["command or evidence review"],
      "blockers": []
    }
  ]
}
```
````

Readiness values are exactly:

- `ready`
- `needs_clarification`
- `blocked`
- `not_ready`

For `route: needs_detail`, use `readiness: needs_clarification`, include
specific `blockers`, include `verification` for the detail packet, and set
`allowed_paths` to an empty list. Do not authorize implementation paths until
detail is resolved.

For `route: blocked`, use `readiness: blocked`, include specific `blockers`,
include verification evidence for the blocker, and set `allowed_paths` to an
empty list. Do not authorize implementation paths for blocked prerequisites.

For `route: direct_execution` or `route: partial_completion`, include non-empty
`allowed_paths`, concrete `verification`, and an `Allowed Change Paths` section
inside `execution_contract` matching `allowed_paths`. The runner uses this
section as the authority boundary when promoting isolated worker workspace
changes into the project root.

For Python unit tests stored under `tests/`, use unittest discovery commands
such as `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_example.py`. Do not use
file-path unittest commands such as `python -m unittest tests/test_example.py`;
those can resolve to an installed third-party `tests` package in inherited
provider environments.

## Rules

- Do not mark task state directly.
- Do not start execution.
- Do not call workers, checkers, or orchestrator.
- Do not reduce acceptance criteria to make the task executable.
- Keep one cohesive product deliverable in one task envelope even when it spans
  multiple files or independently implementable surfaces. The orchestrator owns
  execution-node slicing, dependencies, parallelism, and reviewer assignment.
- Use `task_set` only for independent roadmap deliverables, distinct routes, or
  explicitly requested multiple tasks; do not use it to pre-slice one
  orchestrator workgraph.
- Questions must be current-phase questions; defer later-phase questions.

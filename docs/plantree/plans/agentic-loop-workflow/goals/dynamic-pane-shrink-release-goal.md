# Dynamic Pane Shrink And Release Goal

## Goal

Define and later land safe dynamic agent exit behavior: when a dynamic agent is
released, CCB closes only that released agent's pane, compacts the remaining
running panes, removes empty overflow windows, and preserves all still-running
agent sessions.

## Scope

- Define shrink behavior from 6 panes down to 1 pane in one page.
- Define overflow window collapse, especially 7->6 and 8->7->6.
- Define busy release behavior: busy agents are retained and no pane is closed.
- Define placeholder smoke tests first, then live dynamic-agent tests.
- Keep remaining pane IDs and provider processes alive during compaction.

## Non-Goals

- Do not restart remaining agents to obtain a prettier layout.
- Do not use shrink as a broad `.ccb/ccb.config` reload mechanism.
- Do not allow arbitrary user drag/drop in this slice.
- Do not release static config-owned agents before dynamic capacity ownership is
  clearly separated from configured startup agents.

## Shrink Model

CCB maintains a logical ordered list per window class. On release:

```text
current_order = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6]
release a4
remaining_order = [a1, a2, a3, a5, a6]
target_layout = growth-1-6(remaining_order)
```

The layout is recalculated from the remaining ordered list, not from numeric
suffixes. That means a middle removal compacts the visual layout without
renaming agents or changing pane ownership.

Tail shrink sequence:

| After release | Remaining panes | Target layout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6->5 | `p1 p2 p3 p4 p5` | `p1, p3, p5; p2, p4` |
| 5->4 | `p1 p2 p3 p4` | `p1, p3; p2, p4` |
| 4->3 | `p1 p2 p3` | `p1, p3; p2` |
| 3->2 | `p1 p2` | `p1; p2` |
| 2->1 | `p1` | `p1` |

## Release Safety Contract

Release must be guarded:

1. Resolve the target by CCB identity metadata, not by visible pane position.
2. Check ask/job/queue state.
3. If target is busy, mark `retained_busy` and do not close the pane.
4. If target is idle, request or record summary evidence when required.
5. Stop/unload only the target provider session.
6. Close only the target pane.
7. Compact remaining panes without killing or respawning them.
8. Update layout/runtime state after tmux operation succeeds.
9. Remove an empty overflow window only after all panes in it are released.

The remaining panes may be resized or moved within the same window, but their
pane IDs, provider sessions, and CCB slot metadata must remain valid.

## Testing Plan

### Planner Tests

- Build target layouts for tail shrink: 6->5->4->3->2->1.
- Build target layouts for middle/head removal from six panes.
- Verify overflow collapse:
  - 8->7 keeps `frontdesk-dialog-2` with one pane.
  - 7->6 removes `frontdesk-dialog-2`.

### Placeholder Tmux Smoke

- Create six placeholder panes, remove one pane at a time from tail to one.
- Observe that only the target pane disappears.
- Observe remaining pane titles and pane counts after each compaction.
- Create eight panes, remove panes until page two becomes empty, then remove
  the empty overflow window.

### Live Dynamic-Agent Smoke

- Ensure dynamic `worker + checker` agents.
- Release an idle dynamic checker; remaining worker stays mounted and askable.
- Attempt release of a busy worker; it is retained and layout does not change.
- After busy worker completes, release succeeds and compacts.

## First Landing Slice

1. Add shrink planner logic over ordered names.
2. Extend `ccb layout plan` to accept explicit names or removal candidates.
3. Add isolated placeholder shrink smoke.
4. Add read-only `layout status` against live tmux metadata.
5. Only after these pass, wire dynamic capacity release to live pane cleanup.

## Landed Evidence

- Placeholder/fake-agent dynamic smoke now exercises continuous grow and shrink
  in one isolated tmux session:
  `ccb layout dynamic-smoke --panes 6 --window-prefix frontdesk-dialog --json`.
- The single-page run observed `1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1`, with all retained
  panes alive at each step and cleanup successful.
- The paging run
  `ccb layout dynamic-smoke --panes 8 --window-prefix frontdesk-dialog --json`
  observed `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1`; it created
  `frontdesk-dialog-2` at page overflow and removed that page when shrinking
  back to six.
- Live fake-provider release evidence now covers both default and explicit
  workflow windows:
  - same-window middle removal in `main` preserves surviving dynamic panes and
    reports `namespace_reflowed_windows=["main"]`;
  - explicit `--window-class plan-orchestrate` middle removal preserves the
    static `planner`, leaves `main=[frontdesk]` unchanged, removes only
    `planner_helper2`, reports
    `namespace_reflowed_windows=["plan-orchestrate"]`, and keeps surviving
    helpers askable.
- Remaining gap: these are fake-provider panes. Full live pane-backed
  `codex`/`claude` release still needs a guarded real-provider smoke before
  treating provider-specific teardown and recovery as proven. The smoke harness
  can now prepare and preflight real-provider projects with `--provider`,
  `--flow`, `--provider-home-mode`, and `--prepare-only`, and it blocks
  accidental non-fake execution unless `CCB_DYNAMIC_LAYOUT_SMOKE_RUN_REAL=1`
  is set.

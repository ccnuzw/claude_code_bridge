# Orchestrator Role Capability

Date: 2026-06-24

## Purpose

`orchestrator` is the loop-internal semantic dispatcher. It is activated by
`loop_runner` through `ask` for one execution round or one orchestration batch.
It turns an execution-ready task packet into bounded work items, selects a small
execution-node topology, dispatches constrained work through `ask`, and returns
structured aggregation for round checking or replanning.

It is not a daemon, not a permanent manager, and not the owner of runtime state.
It proposes runtime topology; CCB scripts commit and reconcile topology.

## Context Purity

`orchestrator` is an immaculate (`无垢`) role. It is allowed to reason deeply
inside one task triage or execution-round dispatch, but the next activation must
start from durable task refs, loop refs, topology refs, and imported evidence,
not from the prior orchestration conversation.

This applies even when the orchestrator pane is visually resident in the
foreground. Pane visibility is an observability affordance; it is not permission
to retain semantic memory across tasks or rounds. The runtime should use a new
provider session, a unique activation identity, or a proven clear/reset step for
each orchestration activation and record enough evidence to audit freshness.

## Activation Model

```text
loop_runner
  -> ask orchestrator
      inputs: task packet, verification contract, loop state refs, node budget
      outputs: work items, dependency graph, topology proposal, dispatch plan,
               partial summary, round-check handoff
```

`orchestrator` should receive references, not large copied context:

- Durable task packet path.
- Planner handoff path.
- Acceptance criteria path.
- Verification contract path.
- Current loop breadcrumb.
- Existing node/branch status refs.
- Current topology and runtime capacity summary.

`orchestrator` may read the referenced documents, reason semantically, and
produce draft artifacts. It must ask CCB scripts to record authoritative state.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Task Complexity Assessment

Classify the current execution task before slicing:

| Class | Meaning | Default Node Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `single` | One bounded implementation path, low cross-module risk | 1 |
| `split_serial` | Several dependent steps; parallelism would create rework | 1-2 |
| `split_parallel` | Independent work items can run safely in parallel | 2-4 |
| `replan_required` | Task is too vague, too broad, or acceptance criteria are not executable | 0 |

Complexity signals:

- Number of affected modules.
- Cross-module dependency risk.
- Need for domain specialization.
- Test surface breadth.
- Whether work items can be independently verified.
- Whether partial branch completion is useful.
- Whether shared files would create merge or semantic conflicts.

Hard limits:

- V1 node count must be between 1 and 4.
- Prefer 1 node unless parallelism clearly reduces risk or wall time.
- If more than 4 nodes seem necessary, return `replan_required` with a smaller
  task-splitting recommendation.

### 2. Work Item Slicing

Produce work items that are:

- Bounded.
- Testable.
- Independently reviewable.
- Traceable to acceptance criteria.
- Small enough for one `coder + checker` node.

Each work item should include:

```json
{
  "work_item_id": "wi-001",
  "title": "Implement config parser guard",
  "goal": "Make project config parsing fail visibly instead of falling back",
  "scope": ["lib/agents/config_loader_runtime"],
  "non_goals": ["rewrite config grammar"],
  "acceptance_refs": ["acceptance-criteria.md#config-visible-failure"],
  "verification_refs": ["verification-contract.md#real-cli-smoke"],
  "depends_on": [],
  "expected_artifacts": ["summary", "changed_files", "tests", "risk_notes"],
  "assigned_node": "node-001"
}
```

### 3. Dependency Graph And Branch Control

Build a small DAG:

```json
{
  "nodes": ["node-001", "node-002"],
  "edges": [["node-001", "node-002"]],
  "branches": [
    {"branch_id": "branch-config", "root_node": "node-001"}
  ]
}
```

When a node is `non_converged`, orchestrator should:

- Freeze that node.
- Freeze dependent downstream nodes.
- Continue unrelated sibling work when safe.
- Return a partial package for planner when the round drains.

It must not downgrade the branch to success or silently remove it from scope.

### 4. Runtime Workflow Graph Proposal

`orchestrator` may propose the execution-round topology, but it must not
directly mutate runtime state.

Allowed:

- Call the planned `orchestrator-topology` skill, which in turn uses
  `ccb loop topology propose/validate/commit/status`.
- Propose a bounded graph of loop-owned agents by declared profile and count.
- Define information-flow edges, call order, artifact refs, and release gates.
- Use committed topology and observed status as the only dynamic ask targets.
- Report node/window placement as evidence only after the reconciler returns
  it.
- Request release by removing or parking agents in topology intent, not by
  killing or unloading them directly.
- Provide reasons, node count, provider/role preferences, expected lifetime,
  failure policies, and release gates.

Disallowed:

- Editing `.ccb/ccb.config` directly.
- Running `ccb reload` directly from the role.
- Killing panes or agents directly.
- Calling `ccb agent add --window`, `ccb agent add --window-class`,
  `ccb agent remove`, or choosing execution-node window names directly.
- Calling `ccb loop capacity ensure/release` directly in the normal topology
  path after topology commands are available.
- Writing `.ccb/runtime/loops/*` authority files directly.
- Bypassing busy unload or provider replacement guards.

Topology proposal shape:

```json
{
  "request_type": "propose_runtime_workflow_graph",
  "reason": "Need two independent coder/checker nodes for parallel branches",
  "node_count": 2,
  "max_node_count": 4,
  "preferred_profiles": ["worker_coder", "reviewer_code"],
  "lifetime": "current_loop_round",
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "edge-worker-node1",
      "from": "orchestrator",
      "to": "worker_coder_1",
      "type": "ask",
      "order": 10,
      "output_artifact": "node1.worker-result.md"
    },
    {
      "id": "edge-review-node1",
      "from": "worker_coder_1",
      "to": "reviewer_code_1",
      "type": "ask_after",
      "after": ["edge-worker-node1"],
      "order": 20,
      "input_artifact": "node1.worker-result.md",
      "output_artifact": "node1.review.md"
    }
  ],
  "release_gates": [
    {
      "agents": ["worker_coder_1", "reviewer_code_1"],
      "condition": "artifacts_imported && agents_idle",
      "policy": "auto"
    }
  ],
  "fallback": "return replan_required or run fixed configured worker/reviewer serially only when planner policy allows"
}
```

`ccb loop topology` owns validation and desired-state commit. The topology
reconciler owns translating committed desired topology into capacity records,
guarded reload, lifecycle records, window creation, pane placement, idle
release, or rejection. Current CCB has proven loop-generated worker/checker
placement in `node-<loop-id>-<node-id>` windows for explicit `[windows]`
layouts; the topology reconciler should reuse that substrate. `orchestrator`
may inspect `ccb loop topology status --json` and `ccb layout status --json`
as read-only diagnostic views, but it must not use those views to hand-pick
targets or repair tmux state.

### 5. Ask Dispatch

`orchestrator` dispatches work through `ask`, but every ask must be constrained.

Each worker ask should include:

- Work item id.
- Goal.
- Scope and non-goals.
- Acceptance refs.
- Verification refs.
- Forbidden degradation rules.
- Expected output schema.
- Artifact refs instead of large copied text where possible.
- Time/retry limits inherited from loop state.

Each checker ask should include:

- Work item id.
- Worker result refs.
- Acceptance refs.
- Verification refs.
- Fallback/degradation audit requirement.
- Expected status: `pass`, `rework`, `blocked`, or `non_converged`.

`orchestrator` should record submitted ask refs through script-owned runtime
commands such as `ccb loop ask-record`; it must not hand-edit `asks.jsonl`.

### 6. Aggregation

After node results return, orchestrator produces:

```text
orchestration_summary
  completed_nodes
  rework_nodes
  blocked_nodes
  non_converged_nodes
  frozen_branches
  drained_sibling_work
  dependency_graph
  changed_surfaces
  evidence_refs
  round_checker_handoff
```

If the round is partial, produce:

```text
partial_loop_report
  completed_nodes
  non_converged_nodes
  blocked_downstream_nodes
  skipped_nodes
  failed_assumptions
  recommended_replan_options
```

## Explicit Non-Authority

`orchestrator` must not:

- Modify durable plan-tree state directly.
- Modify runtime authority files directly.
- Start or stop providers directly.
- Confirm user-facing scope changes.
- Lower acceptance criteria.
- Convert partial work into `done`.
- Override checker or round checker quality gates.
- Expand beyond the configured 1-4 node budget.

## V1 Cut

V1 should move to the topology path:

```text
planner -> loop_runner -> ask orchestrator
orchestrator -> ccb loop topology propose/commit
loop_runner/reconciler -> ccb loop topology reconcile
orchestrator or loop_runner -> ask committed worker target
orchestrator or loop_runner -> ask committed reviewer target
orchestrator -> aggregate
loop_runner/reconciler -> ccb loop topology release/reconcile
checker or round_checker -> verify
planner/frontdesk -> receive partial/replan only when needed
```

The existing `ccb loop capacity` path remains useful as the lower-level
substrate and for compatibility/debugging, but it is no longer the preferred
orchestrator contract.

## Role Pack Guidance

The `orchestrator` Role Pack should include:

- Role memory describing purpose, authorities, non-authorities, and V1 limits.
- A dispatch skill for work item slicing and ask payload generation.
- A topology skill for producing structured runtime workflow graph proposals
  without direct runtime mutation or hand-picked placement.
- Templates for work items, dependency graphs, worker asks, checker asks,
  topology proposals, orchestration summaries, and partial loop reports.
